The program reads a list of "tasks" from a file. Each task consists of a character code indicating an action and a number. The character code can be either a "p" (for "process") or "w" (for "wait"). The input file simulates various workloads entering a multiprocessing system. In a real system, the "p" actions (the tasks) would likely be calls to computational routines. For our purposes, "processing" a task with number n just means waiting n seconds using the sleep function and then updating a few global aggregate variables (sum, odd count, min, and max). The "w" action provides a way to simulate a pause in incoming tasks.
